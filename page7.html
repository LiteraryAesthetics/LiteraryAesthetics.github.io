And by that moment we saw the setting skies as the birds fly, a fascinating view, as good as new, all I can think of is you.

When you had it, it will feel like the warmth of the first bloomed flower in spring; it is the soothing breeze that touches your skin beneath the shining sun in summer, the leaves that falls one by one that fills the ground with comfort in autumn, or the great beauty of every falling snow that clings to the atmosphere in every first snow in winter.
<br>
<br>As for me, a first kiss is when we both found the perfect time for our hands to intertwine as your soft red lips that taste like every season touches this curious, mischievous lips of mine.<br><br><br>

                <small>There was once a story about a twisted tale—a legend you once heard marked with a noticeable stain. We all thought that the prince looked for her, searching for the perfect fit with the mysterious glass slipper. But did it really happen at that ball? Did she really run away before the clock ticked twelve?
<br>
<br>You see, there was a different side of how Cinderella lost her slipper. She did not accidentally leave the glass slipper—she grabbed it, held it, then smashed it onto the prince's head. The prince was a motherfucking arsehole, and she was an all-out boss who beats every hypocrite that dares to grieve and maltreat women.&nbsp;<br><br><br></small>

<br>     I love how it broke my heart into million pieces by that time the one I love left me. 
<br>     I love how it made me cry for four straight weeks-a month-or maybe more than that. I love how it tears me up, and make me feel blue, and lonely and sorrowful.
<br>     I love how painful it is. I love how it stays inside and makes you feel like letting go. I love its little imperfections.
<br>     But that one thing that I love the most about heartbreaks is how it made me change. Inspired me to stand up and wipe those tears that came from my lonely eyes that's full of pain. I love how it made me something new, stonger, braver, and better.<br><br>&nbsp;<br></small>

                <small>They say love comes from the most unexpected moments, as when the soothing wind faintly blows by your face. It may come slow, and it may swiftly dash between those little flower petals of spring or the falling leaves by autumn.
<br>
<br>As for me, love knocked onto my door like this:
<br>
<br>The wind blows, drifting and whirling as I walked by. Then before I knew it, I just got dust in my eye. Painful—bearable yet unwanted, like what happens when love takes over. So I closed my eyes, and took the effort to blink as I muster up the courage to tell that I'll get through the pain. Slowly, it faded away and left me an experience that it comes both in painful and joyful ways when you fall in-love.

Unpredictable as you are, you blend with love and sorrow; you cry but you laugh and your words shake from an agreement to an odd disapproval. However, even though how much you stop and go, I admire the way your eyes speak for your soul. You are full of hope, of strength, of bravery and loveliness. You are a total paradox-but you will be the paradox I won't regret I have been confused and have felt attached with. This is what your name sounds like inside my heart.<br><br><br><br></small>

                <small>I've been to the cities of love and walked beneath the vabrant hues of sunlight. I've ran towards the darkest forests and made my way through the night. I've been to many places, but no matter how much happiness lingers around me and no matter how fast I run, my heart says you're still the one.
<br>
<br>I can't deny, you are like the enticement that I can't defy. Your sultry eyes keeps me wondering why—I tried to leave you, but why can't I? Your voice, your fragrance is all that I'm missing. My heart can't deny the reason for its beating. Maybe it's possible that a halt was not coming to stop all our loving and fate keeps on reminding that you will always remain my love, my one and only, because to me, you are my everything.<br><br>

                <small>Books have always been a friend of mine. It gives me inspirations, fear, warmth, happiness—all of it. It gives me freedom to go to different places; from Korea to Canada or either France or China, it lets me explore the world I'm living in.
<br>
<br>And it reminds me of you.
<br>
<br>Of how your fingers trace every page,
<br>the way your eyes glimmer in every letter,
<br>the ardor of sailing towards the unknown;
<br>a world we knew no one could measure.
<br>
