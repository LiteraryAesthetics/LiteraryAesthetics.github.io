There was only darkness that showed up to him, and he felt his hands trembling. He almost couldn't move, but he was too terrified and confused about what happened. He remembered how the car that they are on crashed, making him lose his consciousness. Now that he's awake once again, he got confused why he woke up in a dark room with his hands both tied firmly with a thick rope.

</p><p>&nbsp;Now that he's awake once again, he got confused why he woke up in a dark room with his hands both tied firmly with a thick rope
</p><p>He felt weak. His eyes were blurry, and he could not see anything clearly because it was almost pitch black inside the room. He left out a sigh before he opened his mouth and shouted in full effort. "Hello?"
</p><p>
</p><p>His voice echoed oddly, and a thought came to his mind; he's inside a spacious room. He moved and tried to remove the rope wrapped around his wrists, but he's too weak to do so. That was until he heard a sudden response. "W-who's there?" the familiar voice gave Yohan certainty that there was a person there with him, and he knows him well.
</p><p>
</p><p>"J-Junho? It's me... Yohan!"
</p><p>
</p><p>"Yohan hyung. H-help me, I can't move," Junho's voice had a crack, like he was about to cry. Both his hands were tied too, and all he could see is just the same as what Yohan could.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Me too... I feel weak. I don't know what happened," Yohan responded worriedly.
</p><p>
</p><p>"W-where are the others?"
</p><p>
</p><p>"I don't know. I am tied with a rope, and I couldn't do anything. I feel nauseous," Yohan grumbled as his head started aching. Not long enough, another voice has entered the conversation.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Kim Yohan? Is that you?" the voice said, sounding curious and afraid.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Seungwoo?"
</p><p>
</p><p>"God, Yohan! What's happening? Where are you?" Seungwoo asked immediately, and Yohan gasps.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Seungwoo! Hyung I don't know. I don't feel good, and I can't see anything," Yohan responded with a low and unsteady voice.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Seungwoo hyung, help me they also tied my hands..."
</p><p>
</p><p>"Junho? Junho, I want to help, but I can't. Hyung's hands are tied as well," Seungwoo groaned as his worried voice scattered around the dark room. "Where the hell are we?" Seungwoo asked quietly, taking a view at his surroundings. He looked around and tried to see through the darkness, but he could not catch anything. It was so dark—like a room with no lights and with the door shut.
</p><p>
</p><p>"I don't know, all I can see is darkness–" Yohan didn't get to continue what he was going to say when he suddenly heard a mumbling not too far away. It wasn't one. There were a lot of people heard.</p></div>
