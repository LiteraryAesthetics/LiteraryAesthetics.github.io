            <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 lead"><p>"Wooseok hyung, I seriously think I heard Yohan hyung just now," Hyeongjun's voice was quite optimistic when he knew they weren't the only one trapped. He claimed about hearing Yohan's voice from afar, but he's still not certain if it really is their fun and powerful friend. Their group's center, Yohan.
</p><p>
</p><p>"I don't hear anyone. Does that mean I'm deaf?" Minhee asked, curiously ruining the thought of Kim Yohan's voice.
</p><p>
</p><p>"But you can hear me, Minhee."
</p><p>
</p><p>Wooseok's mind got immediately filled with wonder. "Come to think of it, I've been awake for quite some time now, and I didn't even tried shouting. I'm glad both of you spoke because I wouldn't know you guys are here," he mentioned. However, Hyeongjun couldn't erase the thought of the voice he heard just a few moments ago.
</p><p>
</p><p>"So are we gonna ignore the fact that I heard Yohan hyung shouting?" he asked with a touch of sarcasm.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Of course, we should try doing that too. We don't know where the others are—we don't even know where we are," said Kang Minhee, before he cleared his throat to prepare for a yell.
</p><p>
</p><p>The only thing they are aware of is that the three of them, Wooseok, Hyeongjun and Minhee, has a strong rope-like material wrapped around their wrists. The dark was contributing to the confusion and weakness that their bodies can feel.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Help!" with full effort, Minhee let out a loud yell with the hope of getting a response from the other members. He breathed in and out carefully, for he feels physically tired—just like what Wooseok and Hyeongjun is feeling.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Hyung, I can't shout... My throat hurts," Hyeongjun announced softly, to tell the two boys that he couldn't give any help for now.
</p><p>
</p><p>Wooseok breathed out a sigh, and then he closed his eyes. "I'm sure we're stuck here for a few days now. We haven't eaten anything. My stomach feels so empty," he cooed, a sad tone mingled with the unknown silence of the dark. They can only hear their breathing. Their clueless, hungry and tired breathing.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Just... What happened?" Minhee faintly mused. His eyes half closed, and his sweat rapidly falling down from his hair. "The last thing I can remember was the car crash," he added.
</p><p>
</p><p>Hyeongjun raised his head with furrowed eyebrows. "Car crash? What do you mean?"
</p><p>
</p><p>"You're asleep. You were sleeping with Dongpyo that time, but I'm sure you at least remembered how messed up we are when the car fell sidewards. The left seats were the most affected," Wooseok retaliated with little sniffles. He can still remember it—they got engaged in a car crash on their way home, that's why he's not certain if all the other members of X1 are still alive. His scars and bruises weren't even cured yet.
</p><p>
</p><p>"No, I can't remember. All I know is that we performed at a music show, and then we rode the car, and the music from the earphones stuffed in my ears—"
</p><p>
</p><p>Before Hyeongjun got to continue what he was s saying, a sudden voice was heard from not too far—probably just beside where they are now. "Did I hear Kim Wooseok's voice just a few seconds ago?"
</p><p>
</p><p>"H-Hangyul?" Wooseok asked, surprised. He wasn't hearing Hangyul's voice clearly; he felt like Hangyul was somewhere else, like a room beside where he is.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Wooseok? Are you here? W-where are you? Help me!" the voice yelled, cracking and sounding like he's about to cry. He woke up from another room, hearing, feeling and seeing the same things the three can. They heard another voice that sounded familiar. The voice of their friend, Lee Hangyul. He's not in this room. Where could he be?</p></div>
