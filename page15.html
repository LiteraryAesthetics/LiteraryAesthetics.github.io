            <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 lead"><p>I'm dreaming.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I know for myself that I'm dreaming right now. This dream again. I dreamed about this exact same place a couple of nights ago. A garden, for what it seems like. With trees, plants and flowers everywhere, and even swings and benches. Cool. Like a playground.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm here again. Out of the unknown. Park Erica, from Seoul. I don't live with my parents, only my sister who finished studying last year, and I am currently working part time as a hot dog mascot. Absurd and ridiculous, isn't it? But it's enough profit, since I'll be in my third year in college soon. A few days ago, I just turned 20 years old, and it's a big deal for me since I'm finally legal here in Korea. But since then, I started to have the weirdest dreams of my life, like being killed by a psychopath killer, marrying a shark, and now, I'm even inside a glamorous garden, again! What now? Am I suddenly inside this fairytale world for the second time?
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Whatever, it's just a dream anyway.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I walked slowly and tried exploring the area. This place is just so aesthetic and beautiful. What a lovely place.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"What a lovely scene." I almost jumped and my heart almost fell off when someone suddenly spoke out of nowhere. God, I almost died with that. I rolled my eyes and glanced at whoever spoke earlier. My eyes suddenly widened.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A man.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A handsome guy, to be specific. He was wearing white long sleeves and a pair of trousers. His shoes were gray, his hair was dark, and his eyes were intensely brown; so dark it almost seemed like a black hole. Yep, it looked black.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"H-hey, you startled me—where did you even come from?" I asked and just blinked at the strange guy. He looked at me from head to toe before he walked towards a bench. He sat comfortably as he say the words "I am from the reality."
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What did he say? He's a little confusing. I just blinked twice while scratching the back of my head. "How about you, my lady? Where did you come from?"
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>His voice was just subtle and relaxing; as calm as the waves of the deep deep ocean, and as sweet as the little drops of honey from the treacherous beehives.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"Oh, I am from that big old tree, right there." I said as I pointed out my index finger to a massive tree by my left. That's where I woke up earlier. He immediately looked where I was pointing to, and he just smiled sheepishly. "So that's how it goes. This place again." He murmured as he looked down, making his long eyelashes look exceptionally alluring. He's so handsome—he's almost like a prince from a fairytale. What a man.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"My lady, is it your first time seeing this place?" He suddenly asked, making me wonder why. This is a weird dream. "No, I've been here. A few nights ago, I dreamed about this already."
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"Dream?" He exclaimed as he stood up surprisingly. He's always startling me! How annoying. "A dream inside a dream, is that even possible, my lady?" He promptly questioned. I just rolled my eyes and looked at him, annoyed. "Hey, stranger, stop calling me 'my lady', won't you?!" I blurted out, which made him giggle.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It's not funny. Why is this guy even laughing?
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"Hey, remember," He spoke as he moved closer to me. His eyes were intensely having a contact with mine; that deep brown eyes, "I can call you whatever I want to, I can do whatever I want to. This is my dream. You're just a dream. I decide on what to do with you, my lady."
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My eyes suddenly widened—like, what is he talking about? This isn't his dream! This is my dream. Is he crazy? What kind of dream is this? This is just so so dumb!
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I don't care! It's just a dream anyway.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"Well, if you'll excuse me, Darling, this dream isn't yours." I remarked, tapping his broad, perfect shoulders. "Believe it or not, this whole thing is just inside my head. This place is just inside my thoughts—" I traced my fingers through his chest up to his chin as I leaned my face closer to his. "And you are just a sensation."
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>His eyes widened, and he immediately smirked. "Now I suddenly had something in my mind which can make sense, darling," He looked into my eyes. I could feel his breath, since our faces are just inches away from each other. "What is it?" He grabbed my hand—making my heart flutter. What is this? Why do I feel like this is all real?
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"If I were your sensation, the thought that you could be my sensation too, haven't that crossed your mind?" My eyes widened. I don't understand. Is he telling me that he's dreaming? Like, he's also a real human like me, dreaming the exact same dream I'm having right now?
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>No way.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I quickly pushed myself away from him and blinked twice. I suddenly had a hard time breathing. What is this? This dream was so different.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"Who are you?" I asked the stranger who is currently looking at me without any expression at all. "I'm Hwang Minhyun. May I ask for your name, my lady?" He responded right away.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"I-I'm Erica. Park Erica."
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"Erica, what a lovely name for a lovely lady." I know for myself that I am dreaming, but somehow I felt my heart pounding so fast, as if it was all in reality. What kind of feeling is this?
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now doubts have formed inside my head. Am I truly dreaming?
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"Tell me, am I dreaming?"
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"I'm not certain. I think we both are."
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I opened my eyes, panting, waking up in the world again. I dreamed. It's definitely a dream.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>He's definitely just a dream. I knew it.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Friday, August 17, 2018
</p><p>Dear Diary,
</p><p>
</p><p>I had a dream. About a garden. That garden again.
</p><p>I woke up in a massive tree, and met a handsome
</p><p>guy with a deep brown eyes.
</p><p>His name, Hwang Minhyun.
</p><p>And he was my weirdest dream so far.
</p><p>
</p><p>Confused,
</p><p>—Park Erica.</p></div>
