            <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 lead"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>~Eunjin's Point of View~ </strong><em>This short story was written in 2016.</em></p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;"I bet he didn't call," Daniel told me as we walk slowly at the street by the setting sun. I looked down, and so I felt he was looking at me. "I'm right."</p><p></p><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You've never been wrong about the guys that I like," I said and looked at him as well. A little punch wouldn't hurt that much. My fists got to his broad shoulders, an he just laughed at me. "Hey, why would you laugh at that?"</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">"Guys that you like? You mean, guys that your friend likes for you," he told me, making me realize my mistake once again. I did it again, for the fourth time. I tried finding a boyfriend, but I never get to find one. I guess I'll be living alone my whole life without even having a husband.</span></div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My other friend always tells me about boys that she know, and she always say that maybe I should try to get to know them because they might be the one for me. But it never works out. I guess I'm not that attractive.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then here's my bestfriend, Kang Daniel, always beside me to tell me how foolish I am for believing what others say. "Okay, okay. I admit it. You're right again," I told him and just continued walking. I just looked down and started to feel as lonely as ever. Maybe I should think about becoming a nun? Maybe it'll work out for me.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Eunjin-ah, I've got a suggestion for you. Try this text message trick," Daniel suddenly spoke out loud. He's really annoying.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">And cute.</span></div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh no, I've had enough Kang Daniel," I told him and sighed. I need to get to my house early because it's turning dark soon.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Daniel never noticed me. </div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He's the one that I like. And I don't want to ruin our friendship, but I want to tell him that he's my crush since we were just in elementary. I couldn't, of course. I think he's in-love with someone else even though I know he's single at the moment.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, this one's the best thing you'll ever bet on. I'm sure you'll get a boyfriend tomorrow," he spoke once again, trying to be more annoying than ever. "Listen, Eunjin, there's this text message my classmate got yesterday. He passed it to eleven people and he got a girlfriend earlier, at school. That's crazy right? I think you should try it out."
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, have you tried it out? I guess not. It's not worth it. I'm not doing it Daniel," I told him and just ignored what he said. I suddenly got a text message, and as expected, Daniel passed it to me. What an idiot. He really thought someone would fall for this? I won't try it. "I guess I'll have a girlfriend tomorrow. Poor Eunjin, she doesn't even have an ex boyfriend."
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UGH! DANIEL YOU ANNOYING BRAT.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut up, Daniel. I'm home now. Go home you idiot, you'll never have a girlfriend because you're ugly."
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>And I don't want you to have a girlfriend because it'll hurt me. I know it for sure. You're still the one I like the most, Kang Daniel.
</em></div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I bet 5,000,000 won, I'll get one tomorrow."
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>~That Night~</strong></div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm finally at peace, lying comfortably at my bed. Ahh.
</div><div>
</div><div>I'm thinking about that text message that Daniel talked about earlier. Should I try sending it to eleven people?
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's unfair if he'll get a girlfriend. At least I'll be a bit busy if he gets one. I won't be seeing them that much, and I won't be so jealous. Maybe it won't feel that painful.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div><em>"Love is something that you shouldn't look for at other places. Maybe the love that you're looking for is just right there by your side. Pass this to eleven people, and tomorrow, love will come to you."</em></div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is so cliche and common. I really don't want to try out chain messages, but there's nothing wrong about trying.
</div><div>
</div><div>Just maybe.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>"Sent to 11 contacts."</em></div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>~The Next Day~</strong></div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Goodmorning!" I told the guard and entered the school. It seems like it's a random day.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sigh. I continued walking and just smiled politely to the people that passes by. A random day, it is. Cliche. Common. This is just how it used to be. There's nothing new.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still love him.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eunjin!" I heard someone called my name and so I looked at my back and I saw my friend, Anna. She waved at me and I just waved back at her. She ran towards me and hugged me. "He didn't call yesterday right? I'm sorry if it happened to you again," She told me and I juat gave her a genuine smile.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked and reached a solemn place. It's quiet, but lovely. It's the old school park. No one wants to go in here because it's old. It's still pretty though. I like this place.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well actually I know someone," Anna suddenly opend up a familliar topic. </div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I'm sorry Anna but I'm tired of doing this. No matter what I do, he's still the one I want to be with."
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then confess about how you feel. Tell him everything." </div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't. He's in-love with someone. And besides, it seemed like Daniel was so sure about getting a girlfriend today. Maybe the one he likes will finally give him a yes. I need to move on." I looked down and tears started to form in my eyes.</div><div><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;"><br></span></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">It was really painful.</span></div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They think it's easy to try and pretend all the time, but the more I try to deny it, the more it hurts me. I didn't want to fall in-love with Kang Daniel, because he's my bestfriend and I don't want to ruin what we have, but no matter what I do,
</div><div>
</div><div>The feelings that I have foe him kept coming back. No matter how far I throw it out in the ocean, it always finds its way to get back at the shore.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't understand myself. I shouldn't cry just because of this. I shouldn't feel so down about what is happening.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, hey. Eunjin-ah. The someone that I was talking about earlier... actually... he's here," Anna told me and she stood up. </div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really? If he's here then... I wan't to meet him," I said while wiping out the tears from my eyes. It's hard to fall for someone who's fallen for someone else. So I guess it'll be better to find someone new and make myself believe that this feelings will pass away soon.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna walked away and left me. Maybe she's going to call the guy. It's okay. I'll be as pathetic as I can be, because I want these feelings to go away.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did I even fall for that big idiot? He's annoying and all. I hate him, Kang Daniel.
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I waited for a few minutes. And eventually, someone came.
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was wearing a cute red shirt. And he was holding a bouquet of red roses. Red? That was my favorite color. Maybe he's the one.
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, my world moved slower while he's gets even closer to where I am.
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He's familliar. Broad, perfect shoulders. The right height. The soft skin. The red lips. And that one thing I liked the most about him is that,
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was that annoying big idiot that I hated so much. It was him. <em>Kang Daniel</em>.</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My eyes widened as he finally reached me and stood where I am. "I told you, that text message worked exactly as how I told you it will yesterday," he smiled and me and held my hands. </div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you're not sure about getting a girlfriend today," I tried teasing him.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Won't you say yes?" He asked.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wouldn't say no to you, Mr. Idiot," I answered.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned closer to me and smiled. My heart beats faster than what it used to be. Everyting became colorful. And all I can remember is that the text message that I sent is the main suspect for stealing my precious first kiss.</div><div><br></div><p></p></div>
