            <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 lead"><p>&nbsp;<strong>~Third Person's Point of View~ </strong><em>This short story was written in 2018.</em></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friends are people that are really necessary for every person to have. Having friends makes it easier for every person to learn how to communicate, how to respect people, to help with life lessons, to know how to trust, to feel even happier, to have people that will stay by their sides, and of course, to know what love really means. Sure, all of those can be experienced just by having your family by your side. But isn’t life much more exciting when you have friends around you every time?
</p><div></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jasmine Fernandez knows it all. Friends are really one of the most important parts of her life. Having friends have a very special meaning to her and that’s why she always keeps in touch with people that she thinks she can trust all the time. That includes her one and only best friend since elementary, Ryan Sarmiento.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan has always been there for Jasmine. All of her flaws, her cute habits, and almost everything about her, Ryan knows it all. Even when those times when she desperately needed someone to be with, like when she had her first heartbreak, her second, her third and just every time she has a problem she needs to deal with.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was when they entered the eleventh grade when Jasmine thought that his best friend seemed a little bit attractive. She thought it was just puberty that hit the boy, so it didn’t bother her that much. She also had a lot more friends to hang out with, especially girls like her. She hasn’t been in a relationship since she had her fourth break-up. And now, she’s just enjoying the life of a senior high school student.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hey, Ryan, I didn’t know you can sing well,” a friend of Jasmine named Hailey said as they watched Ryan sing while holding the karaoke microphone. They’re currently having fun inside Hailey’s house.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Of course he can sing well! He won singing competitions when we were in junior high school.” Jasmine told Hailey.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“As expected, you know everything about your eleven-year best friend.”
</div><div>&nbsp;Jasmine rolled her eyes while displaying a sheepish smile. She glanced back at her best friend, who’s currently singing a song by Lea Salonga, entitled ‘Friend of Mine’. Jasmine was astonished by Ryan’s deep and angelic voice, and she just noticed that her heartbeat started to pound fast. She didn’t know what she just felt, but she’s certain that it’s the look in Ryan’s eyes that made her feel that way.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tried to ignore the crazy pounding in his chest, but she failed the moment her and Ryan’s eyes met. “I've loved you then and I love you still, you're a friend of mine.” Ryan looked into Jasmine’s eyes as those words and melodies came out from his lips. And that made Jasmine’s heart pound even faster. She couldn’t bear it no more, so she stood up hesitantly and grabbed her bag. “I think I have to go, guys.”
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What? Already leaving?”
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“S-sorry, I need to go. My mother’s been calling me. I’ll catch up with both of you later.” Jasmine dashed out from Hailey’s house, stuttering. She felt it again, that feeling she felt the last time when she found her best friend attractive. Now she thought to herself, maybe what she feels for Ryan is something different; something more that what ordinary best friends should feel toward each other.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days have passed, and Jasmine decided that she should start avoiding Ryan. Though she wanted to keep it a secret, she told everything to her trustworthy friend, Hailey, since she can’t tell Ryan about it.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“WHAT? YOU LIKE RYAN?”
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hey! I told you this is a top tier secret, why would you yell it out loud, you idiot!” Jasmine shrugged, and rolled her eyes out of annoyance, “Sorry,” Hailey smiled before she covered her mouth using her hands. “Don’t you think Ryan should know about this?” Hailey questioned the dumbfounded girl beside her.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I don’t know. I don’t think Ryan feels the same.” Jasmine cooed as a response to Hailey’s question. “Then you should make him like you back, don’t you think?”
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How am I supposed to do that, Hailey?”
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Just dress up! You’re pretty enough. You just need to appear as a woman to Ryan’s eyes.” Hailey moved her eyebrows up and down while telling Jasmine about her clever idea. The dumbfounded girl just sighed, before Hailey reached for her wrist and dragged her, walking to somewhere only Hailey knows.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A makeover. That’s what Jasmine needs, to make Ryan turn his head to her. Hailey brought her friend to a salon, and then she pushed Jasmine to buy new clothes. Everything that came to her mind was all she told Jasmine to do, though Jasmine thought that she won’t have a chance, ever.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day after that, Ryan came to their classroom early. It was still empty, and no one is there other than himself. He doesn’t have anything to do, so he waited for the time to pass by as he took a nap sitting on his place. Not long after, student started rushing inside the room, and they started making noises. Of course, Hailey was there too, waiting for Jasmine to arrive. It wasn’t too long before she entered the room, all dressed with her new hairstyle. She put on her new perfume, and she looked like someone new, all for Ryan.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jasmine’s smell got into sleeping Ryan, and that was the main reason he woke up, taking a glance at his best friend. His eyes widened, and his eyes travelled from Jasmine’s head down to her toes. “Well…” The sight of Jasmine slowed down his world, and the shy girl avoided looking at his eyes, blushing. “You… Look different.”
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“D-different? What? I’ve been like this all the time.”
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Well, fine, your crush won’t notice you anyway.” Ryan shrugged, before he pulled himself back to sleep. Jasmine’s jaw dropped, for it wasn’t what she expected.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All her efforts seemed to appear useless. It looks as if he doesn’t care about her new look at all. But the good thing is, Jasmine started to have more boys around her.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days, nights, and weeks have passed with Jasmine trying out everything she can for Ryan to notice her. She doesn’t want him to just look at her as a best friend, or someone close to him. She wanted to appear as a girl. But it seems as if nothing’s working out for Ryan. “I’m pretty sure that you’re in-love with a new guy. Who is it?”
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Nothing! Why do you keep on asking me?” Jasmine chided, turning his eyes away from Ryan with a disappointed facial expression. “I need to go. I’ll leave you with Hailey, so just enjoy singing the karaoke, you punk!” She dragged herself outside Hailey’s house, leaving like a mad kid. It wasn’t working, and it’s all useless. She thinks that it’ll be no use, so she should just stop all of this nonsense. “Ryan, you’ll only look at me as a friend in the end.” She told herself when she finally got out of Hailey's place.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did stop. She gave up, and it was the first time she gave up with a guy. If they will only end up as friends, then let be it. Months will pass, and he’ll still be the same, joking around her, laughing like idiots, acting in such a ridiculous way. Because that’s what friends are.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was that time when they have to go home late because of a school project. They finished making their project when it was dark outside already. Jasmine was waiting for a bus to come her way, so she can go home already. She’s alone. Though Ryan’s one of her groupmates, she didn’t even bother to ask Ryan to come home with her.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she heard a voice unexpectedly, “Jasmine!”
</div><div>&nbsp;The voice seemed familiar, and by the moment Jasmine turned her attention to whoever it is, her heart started beating faster again. All those times, she kept on asking how Ryan suddenly looked attractive, and even now when he’s running towards her direction.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jasmine just looked at him, as if Ryan was all she can see. When Ryan stopped in front of her, panting, she finally got away from Ryan’s unavoidable stunning power. A bus has stopped in front of them, and it seems like Ryan just came perfectly.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They took a seat together, with awkwardness filling the air. It was a few moments of silence that stayed between them. “Hey, you sprayed on a different scent today, Jasmine.” Finally, after a few minutes, Ryan broke the silence between the two of them.  “So what? You don’t even care.”
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What did you say?”
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You just don’t really know, don’t you?!” Jasmine exclaimed, and she probably spoke a little too loud. And there goes her emotions again, making her heart beat faster. And she didn’t want it anymore. She hated the feeling, and the idea of her liking her own childhood best friend.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jasmine stood up with a mad expression. She walked to the driver, and left Ryan all confused. “Just drop me off here, please.” She said, with complete sadness taking over her mind. The bus stopped, and she quickly found herself running down the vehicle. With Ryan being worried, he did the same and followed his best friend down.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Jasmine, wait—”
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Don't follow me! Just leave me alone...”
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Did I say something wrong? I just said that I smelled a new scent, I actually think it's good—” Ryan didn't get to finish his question when Jasmine looked at him in the eyes. “Can't you still see? I like you!”
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jasmine finally did it. She did what she needs to do. She confessed how she feels for him, and now that he knows it, she still wasn't hoping for anything. She accepted that Ryan would never look at her more than just a friend. Jasmine looked down and avoided Ryan's eyes immediately.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan was shocked—he didn't know what to do. His heart was racing too at that time, and his eyes were just widened. He was humiliated by Jasmine's abrupt confession. “I... I don't care if you don't like me. It's okay if you'll only look at me as a friend, because I did everything, but still all of it didn't work out.” Jasmine's sad voice was heard in the street with the sounds of cars dashing.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I never felt like this before... I never once thought that I'd be like this because of you. I never thought I'd fall for you, but I just couldn't stop my heart. It beats everytime I see you smile,” Jasmine added. “So I want to end it here now. Let's... Not be friends anymore. You'll keep on hurting me like this—”
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You're right.” Ryan then, interrupted her. “We shouldn't be friends anymore. Because everytime I look at you, I get even crazier.” He stated, making the girl in front of her raise her head and look back at his eyes. “All those times I've been telling myself that I'm such a fool for ignoring the things you've been showing me, because I thought I'd end up being hurt,”
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ryan... What are you talking about?”
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What I'm saying is I like you more than you like me, idiot!” Ryan exclaimed before he pulled his best friend towards him. Jasmine couldn't do anything, for she was very surprised by Ryan's sudden action.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She never thought that Ryan would hug her that time. And that's when everything had an answer. They liked each other, but they were both so shy so they couldn't even tell. They're both fools, for acting so cowardly about their feelings. And they're both so dumb, for taking it this far.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Let's officially stop being friends. You're not just a friend of mine, Jasmine.” Ryan shrugged as he squirmed away slowly from his friend, and then he looked at her sparkling eyes. “You are somewhat more special,” was the last thing he said before he leaned his face closer to Jasmine's.
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then they kissed.
</div><div><br></div><p></p></div>
